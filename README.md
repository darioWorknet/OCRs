# OCR - Optical Character Recognition 

In this repo, different ways of extracting text data from images will be explored.

One uses Python Tesseract library to convert image to .txt

Another uses a web API to extract text from images (better results from my experience)

In both methods, the Python script convert all images in the specified folder in order to automate work.
